1)Some class may have  a log of functionality method
2) lot of function inside a class is a problem
3) so we made another class name classFacade
3) and inside the class 
4) in the constructor class you init the bigclass that you derive
5) and take some method that you need fom the bif class
6) and in your facade class this method will be returned with a new name
7) then when it is needed from the main program you can just call the fascade class
8) so the only yhe method you need will be avialable
9) its like a dependency injection so that when in invoke a method 
10) from one class it actually point another method from another class
