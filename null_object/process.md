1) if the object is not initialized
2) or the property of a class is not filled
3) and if you try to access from any progam
4) it will show a null reference
5) how to fix the atribute null reference
6) you can make a interface 
7) then another clas will implement the interface
8) with propertices and their getter and setter must have  a default
9) value so you have to implement the method and the attribute are always
10) sending some value thats have default value


11) another thing you can do is when we throw null refrence
12) we can make a new class implementated from the interface
13) and then in this implementation we can set a defaut value
14) and when we have throw null exception we throw this type insed of null exception
15) so always you will find something
